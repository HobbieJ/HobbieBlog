My personal blog/portfolio, with the source code freely available for anyone who wants to take a peek!

This site was made on a [Dell XPS 15](http:www.dell.com/XPS15) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).
This site also uses a Jekyll theme called [Paper](https://github.com/mkchoi212/paper-jekyll-theme) created by [Mike JS. Choi](https://deadbeef.me/).

If you want to start your own Jekyll blog I'd reccomend the following:
- Start with the Jekyll quick guide to get yourself familiar with the technology [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
- Once you are familiarized, go ahead and choose a theme, (if you're not building your own), and follow their instructions. To use my theme, head [here](https://deadbeef.me/paper-jekyll-theme/2017/07/quick-start).
