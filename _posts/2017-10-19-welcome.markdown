Welcome to my blog website!

I'm really excited to show you not just what I've been working on as a programmer, but also what I've been working on in school, as well as life! I do a variety of things, and I'd love to show them all off to anyone who's interested in it!

I'll keep this short, since this is a soft launch, but welcome again, feel free to subscribe to the RSS feed if you like, especially while I dive headfirst into Ruby and Jekyll, and we'll talk to you soon!
