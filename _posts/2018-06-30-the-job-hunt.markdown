Hello Internet!

I wanted to take a quick moment and let everyone know that I'm looking for employment! I'm almost finished with my final work on my Thesis, and I'll be ready to start working here very soon. So, if you have a position open for a recent graduate, with a background in C#, web development, IT, and entrepreneurship, with honors, then please email me at [contact@jacobhobbie.com](mailto:contact@jacobhobbie.com). I've worked at large non-profits and international corporations, as well as small non-profits and my own small company I started when I was 18. I'm always happy to learn new things too, and I'm pretty good at it if I do say so myself. I'm also never afraid to say when I was wrong, or when I don't know something, if you're looking for a good team member as well as employee ðŸ˜„.

If you're looking for something more official, you can reach my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hobbiej/), with my updated CV, and all my past experience and awards.

With that, I bid you a great day!
